1. install node

2. terminal type: 
  npm install -g typescript

3 due to the browser does not support ts, on terminal type:

tsc sandbox.ts sandbox.js // means ts comile to js 

note:

if they have same file name or the js file does not exist, simply type in:

tsc sandbox.ts

4. after the file has been created, may see errors in ts const variable, it because both js and ts have the same, close one of them solve the problem.
again, browser only runs the .js file not the ts file, so it won't effect any thing
